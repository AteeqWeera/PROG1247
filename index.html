    <h2>Poetry</h2>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/rumi">
                "Rumi's poetry is characterized by themes of love, mysticism, and the search for divine truth."
                <p>I AM THINE AND THOU ART MINE
                    Rumi
                    (trans. by R.A. Nicholson)<br>
                    Eternal Life is gained
                    by utter abandonment of one’s own life.<br>
                    When God appears to His ardent lover,
                    the lover is absorbed in Him,<br> and not so much as a hair of the lover remains.<br>
                    True lovers are as shadows,
                    and when the sun shines in glory the shadows vanish away.<br>
                    
                    He is a true lover to God to whom God says
                    “I am thine and thou art Mine.”</p>

            <h2>Famous Quote</h2>
            <p>
                One of Rumi's famous quotes:
                <q cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/875661.Jalal_ad_Din_Muhammad_ar_Rumi%3E">
                    "The minute I heard my first love story,
                    I started looking for you, <br>not knowing
                    how blind that was.
                    Lovers don't finally meet somewhere.
                    They're in each other all along."</q><br>
